# Stock-Data-Analysis-and-Visualization-
## **Overview**
This project is a Python-based solution designed to retrieve, analyze, and visualize stock market data using the Yahoo Finance API. It demonstrates the capabilities of Python in financial data handling, including data extraction, manipulation, and visualization, making it a valuable resource for data enthusiasts, analysts, and developers.

## **Features**
- Extract historical stock data for multiple companies using `yfinance`.
- Save stock data into structured Excel files with `pandas` and `openpyxl`.
- Generate insightful visualizations, including line graphs of stock price trends.
- Handle and debug common issues, like missing dependencies or malformed data

## **Technologies Used**
- **Python 3.8+**: Core programming language for the project.
- **Libraries**:
  - `yfinance` - Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance API.
  - `pandas` - Handle and manipulate the extracted data.
  - `matplotlib` - Create data visualizations for analysis.
  - `openpyxl` - Export the results to Excel files.
    
## **Project Workflow**
1. **Stock Data Retrieval**:
   - Fetch daily stock data for specified companies and date ranges.
2. **Data Saving**:
   - Save the extracted data into Excel files for further analysis or reporting.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Create line charts to display daily closing price trends for selected companies.
4. **Error Handling**:
   - Debug and resolve common issues like missing libraries or incorrect column names.
     
## **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/stock-data-analysis.git
   cd stock-data-analysis
   ```
2. Install the required libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
   Example of `requirements.txt`:
   ```
   yfinance
   pandas
   matplotlib
   openpyxl
   ```
## **How to Use**
1. Update the `stock_symbol`, `start_date`, and `end_date` in the script with your desired company ticker and date range.
2. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python stock_analysis.py
   ```
3. The script will:
   - Fetch stock data from Yahoo Finance.
   - Save the data as an Excel file.
   - Display visualizations of stock price trends.
     
## **Example Code Snippets**

### **Data Extraction**
```python
import yfinance as yf
import pandas as pd

# Parameters
stock_symbol = "AAPL"
start_date = "2025-02-01"
end_date = "2025-02-28"

# Fetch stock data
stock_data = yf.download(stock_symbol, start=start_date, end=end_date)

# Save to Excel
excel_filename = f"{stock_symbol}_stock_data.xlsx"
stock_data.to_excel(excel_filename)
print(f"Stock data saved to {excel_filename}")
```
### **Data Visualization**
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Plot closing prices
plt.plot(stock_data['Close'], color='blue', label=f'{stock_symbol} Closing Price')
plt.title(f'{stock_symbol} Stock Price Movements (Feb 2025)')
plt.xlabel('Date')
plt.ylabel('Price')
plt.legend()
plt.grid()
plt.show()
